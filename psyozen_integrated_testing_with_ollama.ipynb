Thought Record: Keep a daily thought record. When you experience strong negative emotions, write down the situation, your automatic thoughts, and your emotional response. Then, challenge these thoughts and write down more balanced alternatives.2. Cognitive Restructuring Practice: Continue to question your automatic thoughts, especially those involving absolutes like 'always' or 'never'. Look for evidence that contradicts these thoughts.3. Behavioral Experiment: Test your beliefs. For instance, for one week, give more detailed responses about your day and express when you're feeling tired. Observe Emma's reactions and compare them to your predictions.4. Communication Skills Training: Practice using 'I' statements to express your feelings without blaming. For example, 'I feel overwhelmed when I come home from work' instead of 'You don't understand how hard I work'.5. Mindfulness Exercises: Incorporate mindfulness techniques to help you stay present and respond thoughtfully rather than react automatically in stressful situations.6. Positive Activity Scheduling: Plan and engage in activities you both enjoy. This can help create positive experiences and challenge the belief that 'nothing is ever good enough'.7. Gratitude Journal: Each day, write down one thing you appreciate about Emma. This can help balance negative thoughts and improve your overall perception of the relationship.8. Regular Check-ins: Schedule short, daily check-ins with Emma where you both share your thoughts and feelings. This can improve communication and challenge the belief that you 'never want to talk'.Remember, changing thought patterns and behaviors takes time and practice. Be patient with yourself and celebrate small improvements. If you find these techniques helpful, consider seeking a couples therapist who can guide you both through this process more comprehensively.\" } ]\n",
